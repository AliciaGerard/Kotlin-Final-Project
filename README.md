# Kotlin Final Project Fall 2019

We were given the database code and we were required to create some parts of the program

 - Must create a gui for a user to enter a string and add it to a list displayed below
 - Created an add button that adds the string to the list
 - Created a delete button that will remove all strings of the same name
 - Uses SQL Kotlin to add and remove from the database
